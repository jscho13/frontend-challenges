### Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The table was created with a popular library called [React Table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table).

Ideally we would make the table on our own to minimize dependencies. This would give us a finer degree of control for clients who ask for additional features. It could certainly be done in a days worth of work, but within an hour give or take it's too tight.

Particulary functions like sorting and pagination are difficult to implement within the alloted time. We would need to chunk the json and take in parameter for specific pages.
