### Starting the App

> npm install

Should install all relevant dependencies

> npm start

Runs the app in the development mode (hopefully). Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Ideally I would use a barebones version of React instead of bringing on thousands of extra dependencies (yuck).

Particulary functions like sorting and pagination are difficult to implement within the alloted time. We would need to chunk the json and take in parameter for specific pages.
